# Magento

[Magento](https://magento.org/) is a feature-rich flexible e-commerce solution. It includes transaction options, multi-store functionality, loyalty programs, product categorization and shopper filtering, promotion rules, and more.

## Introduction

This chart bootstraps a [Magento](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-magento) deployment on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

It also packages the [Bitnami MariaDB chart](https://github.com/kubernetes/charts/tree/master/stable/mariadb) which is required for bootstrapping a MariaDB deployment as a database for the Magento application.
